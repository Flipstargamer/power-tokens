To gain a power you must first craft one of the power tokens. There are three different types of power tokens.
* Unstable Token - Cheapest, however provides two debuff powers for a random buff power.
* Power Token - Provides a random buff power alongside a random debuff power.
* Reinforced Token - Provides a random buff power only.
* Selective Token -  Allows you to pick one random buff power and one downside. **(Not Implemented Yet)**

### Reseting
You may be unsatisfied with your debuffs, so you can craft an Inverted Token to remove all your powers. However, this includes all your buffs.
